## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- I built this project to serve as an intoductory to the lessons I will learn during the bootcamp
- Building this webpage begins to help solve the problem of my utter lack of knowledge in this course
- What did I learn? Where to even begin? I had zero experience with git, html, css, or js prior to beginning the prework study guide

## Installation

## Usage

The prework study guide will serve as a reference to look back on when I inevitably struggle with html, css, js, and git.
